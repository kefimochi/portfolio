### PLEASE KEEP IN MIND EVERYTHING HERE(BOTH CODE & DESIGN) HAS NOT BEEN TOUCHED SINCE 2019!!

Open-sourced code of my porfolio, demonstrating the projects I've worked on in the past.

First clone it by entering `git clone <link>` after which use `Live Server` extension in VSCode to run it.

*Will be redisigned in the near future!
